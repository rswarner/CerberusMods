CerberusMods
============

Changes I've made while building my Cerberus deltabot 3D printer

I've designed the mods included here while building my Cerberus, based on Steve Graber's excellent design. My printer is a dual extruder 250 mm version. It has flying extruders in order to reduce the length of the Bowden tubes. One extruder runs 3 mm filament and the other runs 1.75 mm filament. I figured flexible materials would be better at the larger diameter, while I wanted to run more common materials at 1.75 mm. I'm looking forward to multimaterial prints with flexible and rigid parts.
