Changes I've made while building my Cerberus deltabot 3D printer

First, many thanks to Steve Graber for the Cerberus design, and to Printrbot for making my first 3D printer and for being such a cool company.

Magnetic Joints: I had this idea early on while building my Cerberus, and I've followed it down a bit of a rabbit hole. I'm really happy with the joints. They have no lash whatsoever, are dry, and the fabrication of the joints themselves is highly repeatable. The design was something I couldn't let go of. The downside is the strength of the joint to resist forces imparted by the Bowden tubes and wire harness to the end effector. It took me a few revisions to get to this configuration. In order to reduce the forces involved, I designed a flying extruder set up, which is still a work-in-progress. I am having great success running dual extruders, one 3 mm and the other 1.75 mm. 

One benefit of the socket design is that in a crash of the end effector to the build surface, the joints just let go instead of damaging anything.
